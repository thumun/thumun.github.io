								<h3>Game Development Research Assistant</h3>
								<p><a href="https://alinen.net/">Motion Lab</a><br>
									<i>May 2022 - Present</i></p>

								<p>Currently working with Professor Aline Normoyle at Bryn Mawr College. 
									<br><br>This research is focused on studying the elements of game design with a focus on level design, puzzle design, and issues of control (specifically, the interaction between the game and the player). 
									<br>These elements were explored in the development of two games: <br>a Monument Valley-esque game and Q*Bird.
									
									<br><br> As part of an independent study (related to the research), I explored path and motion planning algorithms for digital characters with a focus on virtual map representations, Dijkstra's algorithm, A*, and locomotion controllers. 
									<br>This culminated in a literature review and Guide to A* for teaching purposes.  

									<br><br> I am currently focusing on the controllers within Q*Bird as well as data analysis on AR games to understand the current market for AR. 
									<br> The controllers that I will be creating are the tilt controller and the light-tracing controller.  

									<br><br> More information (of the games mentioned above) can be found in the projects section.

								<h3>Computer Science Teaching Assistant</h3>
								<p><b>Introduction to Data Structures</b><br>
								<i>Jan 2023 - May 2023</i></p>

								<p><b>Programming Languages and Computer Architecture</b><br>
								<i>Sep 2022 - Dec 2022</i></p>

								<p>I primarily assisted students with labs and understanding concepts in the course. This usually involved going over code in C++, C, or HERA (Haverford's assembly language) or giving hints on how to construct various circuits in Logisim.  </p>

								<hr>

								<h3>Makerspace Student Worker</h3>
								<p><i>Sep 2021-Present</i></p>
								<p> I help manage and operate the machines in Haverford's Makerspace. 
									<br>Specifically, I have helped students in operating the 3D Printer, Laser Cutter, and Vinyl Cutter for a diverse set of projects. 
									<br><br>
									I have also assisted students in formulating ideas and guiding them through the prototyping process. This typically involves teaching them how to use certain software (specifically from the Adobe Suite or other design-based software) and how to best utilize one of the machines in the space for their idea.
									<br><br>
									I also create and host workshops related to the Makerspace. I have successfully hosted two Robotics workshops (2021, 2022) that involved using a microcontroller, sensors, Arduino, and miscellaneous items in the Makerspace to create your own robot. 
									<br>I plan on conducting workshops to teach game design and skeletal animation in Unity.  </p>
								<hr>

								<h3>Make & Design Fellowship</h3>
								<p><i>May 2021-July 2021</i></p>
								<p>My team and I designed and prototyped educational toys for two local non-profits, Turning Points for Children and Playful Learning.  
									<br><br>
									For Turning Points for Children, we designed and created a toy that would teach the children that they work with about the organization's 5 core principles. The toy itself was colorful, had textures (to make it appealing and accessible to all children), and was durable. 
									<br>To create this toy, we made prototypes from cardboard and then out of wood (via a laser cutter). The toy itself was was designed in Fusion 360 and Adobe Illustrator. The final product was 3D printed and assembled by the team. 
									<br><br>
									For Playful Learning, we designed an educational wildlife I-Spy set. This set consisted of a custom-made bench, windchimes, and animal plaques which would be placed in a park (or any place of their choosing). These different components were each accompanied by educational material (presented in a fun manner) that would hopefully foster an interest in the sciences.
									<br>We primarily used Fusion 360, Adobe Illustrator, the laser cutter, and acrylic paints during the process of designing this toy set. </p>

								<h3>Digital Scholarship Assistant</h3>
								<p><i>Jan 2021-May 2021</i></p>
								<p>I designed a website that provides access to manumissions from a database.

							<h3>Q*Bird</h3>
							<p><i>Fall 2022</i>
								<br>
								Implemented A* (pathfinding algorithm).
								<br><br><i>Summer 2022</i><br>
								A mobile augmented reality game that was designed to implement and test four different control schemes (specifically, button and gestural controls that are with respect to the player and with respect to the world). Currently in the process of adding an AI agent that gives the player varying levels of agency over the character controls. 

								<br><br>
								My contribution was mainly game/level design, creating/editing controllers, and implementing AR. I created the level that we will use for our experiment (assets not made by me). The gameplay video shows the point-and-click controller in action.

							<h3>"Monument Valley" (MV)</h3>
							<p><i>Summer 2022</i>
								<br>
								A stylistic puzzle game focused on a player navigating their way through levels by manipulating various mechanics. This version of the game is meant to be an experiment in finding what constitutes to creating an effective puzzle. In other words, finding which kind of puzzle is both appealing and gives the player a sense of accomplishment. 

								<br><br>
								My contribution to the project was creating UI elements, a negative feedback alert, data analysis on initial experiment results, and level design-specifically for the tutorial levels.

							<h3>Yokai · Land</h3>
							<p>
								Originally designed as a multiplayer table-top game with a Python component. 
								<br>Players are to compete with one another to reach the end of the board. However, yokai (mythical Japanese monsters/spirits) may stand in their way. 
								<br> Players can carefully conduct themselves with Yokai through conversation or items or can choose to fight (at the risk of endangering themselves).
								<br> If a player's health is too low, they much rejuvenate at a Shrine or start from the very beginning. 
								<br> There is also an additional challenge from other players who may use Curses to target other players. 
								<br><b>More information can be found in the guidebook. </b>

								<br><br>Currently in the process of turning this into a fully digital board game.

							<h3>Projects from '3D-Computer Modeling' [Fall 2022]</h3>
							<p> For 3D-Computer Modeling, I was tasked with three projects: creating a tool, an environment, and a figure. These projects were all created in Maya using the Arnold Renderer and Photoshop for texturing.
								<br>For the tool, I created a "Dragon Blade" based on images found on the internet.  
								<br>The environment is inspired by catacombs from the video game, Witcher 3. 
								<br>The humanoid figure is based on an original character of mine. 
							</p>

							<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
							<p> I created a bust of an original character of mine using NomadSculpt (sculpting) and Procreate (texturing).

								The pages will tell a story about the deities present within a world I created. 
								I will bind the book myself and I am envisioning a rustic, old journal look to the book.
